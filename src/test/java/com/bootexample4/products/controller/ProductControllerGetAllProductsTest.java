"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns all the products correctly

Details:
  TestName: testGetAllProducts.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAllProducts correctly fetches all the products from the repository. We are testing the basic functionality of the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: We will need to mock the ProductRepository and its findAll method to return a list of products.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected products list.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method getAllProducts correctly fetches all the products from the repository. The expected result is the list of products returned by the mocked repository. This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of our method.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method handles the case when no products are present

Details:
  TestName: testGetAllProductsWithNoProducts.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAllProducts handles the case when no products are present in the repository. We are testing the method's ability to handle edge cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: We will need to mock the ProductRepository and its findAll method to return an empty list.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected empty list.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method getAllProducts correctly handles the case when no products are present in the repository. The expected result is an empty list. This test is significant as it checks the method's robustness and its ability to handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method handles the case when the repository throws an exception

Details:
  TestName: testGetAllProductsRepositoryException.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAllProducts handles the case when the repository throws an exception. We are testing the method's error handling capabilities.
Execution:
  Arrange: We will need to mock the ProductRepository and its findAll method to throw an exception.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method getAllProducts correctly handles the case when the repository throws an exception. The expected result is the exception thrown by the method. This test is significant as it checks the method's error handling capabilities.

/*
The errors in the logs indicate that there's an issue with the Spring Application Context initialization. The test execution is failing to load the Application Context, which is essential for running the test cases in spring boot application where we need to inject dependencies in our tests.

The root cause of the issue is a `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError` for `org/springframework/beans/factory/aot/BeanRegistrationExcludeFilter`. This error typically occurs when the class loader cannot find a certain class definition that is required for the test execution.

In this case, the class `org.springframework.beans.factory.aot.BeanRegistrationExcludeFilter` is not found. This class seems to be related to the Spring AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation feature, which is a part of Spring Native project. It's likely that the project is missing the required dependencies or the correct version of Spring Boot or Spring Native.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the project has the correct and necessary dependencies for Spring AOT. Also, make sure to use compatible versions of Spring Boot and Spring Native. If the project is not intended to use Spring Native or AOT features, consider removing those dependencies or configurations. 

Please note that this is not a code issue in the given unit test or the method under test. It's a configuration or environment issue related to the project's dependencies and Spring Boot setup.

    List<Product> result = productController.getAllProducts();
    assertEquals(productList, result, "Expected and actual products list should match");

/*
The error logs suggest that the test case is failing due to the inability to load the application context. This issue is due to the missing class `org.springframework.beans.factory.aot.BeanRegistrationExcludeFilter`.

This class is part of the Spring AOT (Ahead-of-Time) module, which is used to pre-process your Spring application during the build time for faster startup and lower runtime memory requirements. It appears that this module is missing or not properly configured in your test environment.

This could be due to several reasons:
- The Spring AOT dependency might not be included in the project's dependencies.
- The version of Spring Boot used in the project might not be compatible with the Spring AOT module.
- There could be a classpath issue that is preventing the class from being found.

The appropriate action would be to ensure that the necessary dependencies are included and properly configured in your project. You also need to check the compatibility of your Spring Boot version with the Spring AOT module. If the problem persists, you might need to investigate potential classpath issues.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testGetAllProductsWithNoProducts() {
    when(productRepository.findAll()).thenReturn(Collections.emptyList());
    List<Product> result = productController.getAllProducts();
    assertEquals(Collections.emptyList(), result, "Expected and actual products list should match");
}

/*
The test failure is not directly related to the business logic of the method or the test case itself. Instead, the issue is related to the Spring Boot Application Context not being able to load during the test execution, which results in a java.lang.IllegalStateException.

From the error log, it can be seen that the root cause of the issue is a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError for the class org.springframework.beans.factory.aot.BeanRegistrationExcludeFilter. This class is a part of the Spring Framework, and it seems like it's not available in the classpath during the test execution. This might be due to a missing or incompatible Spring Boot or Spring Framework dependency.

To fix this issue, you should check your project's dependencies. Make sure that all necessary Spring Boot and Spring Framework dependencies are included in your project and that they are compatible with each other. Also, ensure that the required versions of these libraries are correctly downloaded and available in the classpath during the test execution. If you recently upgraded your Spring Boot or Spring Framework version, you might need to check for any breaking changes or class deprecations in the new version.
