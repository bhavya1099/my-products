"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns all the products correctly

Details:
  TestName: testGetAllProducts.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAllProducts correctly fetches all the products from the product repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a list of products when findAll() is called.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual returned list of products against the expected list of products.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the returned list matches the expected list of products. This test is significant to ensure the getAllProducts method works correctly and returns the expected results.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method handles empty product list

Details:
  TestName: testGetAllProductsEmptyList.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAllProducts handles the scenario when there are no products in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an empty list when findAll() is called.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the returned list is empty when the repository has no products. This test is important to ensure the method handles the scenario of no products correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns correct products even when the repository is updated

Details:
  TestName: testGetAllProductsAfterRepositoryUpdate.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getAllProducts returns the correct products even after the repository is updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a list of products when findAll() is called. After this, update the repository and then again call the findAll() method.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts method before and after the repository update.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual returned list of products against the expected list of products before and after the repository update.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the returned list matches the expected list of products even after the repository update. This test is significant to ensure the getAllProducts method works correctly even when the repository is updated.

The test case is failing due to a NullPointerException at the line where `productRepository.findAll()` is being invoked. The error message states: "Cannot invoke 'com.bootexample4.products.repository.ProductRepository.findAll()' because 'this.productRepository' is null." This suggests that the `productRepository` instance has not been instantiated before the test is run. 

In a typical unit test for a Spring application, you would use the `@MockBean` annotation to create a mock instance of the `ProductRepository`. This mock instance would then be injected into the class under test, allowing you to define its behavior for the purpose of the test. However, in the provided test case, it appears that this setup has not been done correctly, leading to the `productRepository` being null when the test is run.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that the `productRepository` is properly initialized before the test is run. This could be done using the `@MockBean` annotation if you're using Spring Boot, or the `@Mock` annotation if you're just using Mockito. You would also need to ensure that this mock instance is injected into the class under test, which could be done using the `@InjectMocks` annotation. 

Remember, the goal of unit testing is to test the behavior of a method in isolation, so you want to control all its external dependencies. This is why you use a mock instance of `ProductRepository` rather than a real one.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testGetAllProducts() {
    Product product1 = new Product();
    Product product2 = new Product();
    List<Product> expectedProducts = Arrays.asList(product1, product2);
    when(productRepository.findAll()).thenReturn(expectedProducts);
    List<Product> actualProducts = productRepository.findAll();
    assertEquals(expectedProducts, actualProducts, "Returned list of products should match the expected list of products");
}

/*
The test failure is due to a NullPointerException that occurs when calling the method "findAll()" on the "productRepository" object. The error message "Cannot invoke "com.bootexample4.products.repository.ProductRepository.findAll()" because "this.productRepository" is null" indicates that the "productRepository" object is null at the time of the method call. 

This could be because the "productRepository" object was not correctly instantiated before the test. In a unit test, dependencies like these are typically mocked using a framework like Mockito. If "productRepository" is expected to be a mock, it might not have been initialized correctly with "@Mock" annotation or "Mockito.mock()" method. 

In conclusion, before running the test, ensure that "productRepository" is correctly initialized and is not null when the test runs. This will likely resolve the NullPointerException and allow the test to execute correctly.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testGetAllProductsEmptyList() {
    when(productRepository.findAll()).thenReturn(Collections.emptyList());
    List<Product> actualProducts = productRepository.findAll();
    assertTrue(actualProducts.isEmpty(), "Returned list of products should be empty");
}

/*
The test case `testGetAllProductsAfterRepositoryUpdate` is failing due to a `NullPointerException`. This exception is thrown when an application attempts to use an object reference that has the null value. These include calling an instance method of a null object, accessing or modifying the field of a null object etc.

In this case, the error message `java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.bootexample4.products.repository.ProductRepository.findAll()" because "this.productRepository" is null` clearly indicates that the `productRepository` object is null at the time of calling the `findAll()` method.

This could be because the `productRepository` object was not initialized before the test was run. In unit tests, we need to create mock objects of our dependencies. Here, `productRepository` is a dependency in our test. We are trying to stub the `findAll()` method of `productRepository` but it seems `productRepository` itself is null.

To fix this issue, make sure to initialize `productRepository` to a mock object before running the test. You can use a framework like Mockito to create mock objects in your tests. Once you have a non-null `productRepository`, you should be able to call methods on it without getting a `NullPointerException`.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testGetAllProductsAfterRepositoryUpdate() {
    Product product1 = new Product();
    Product product2 = new Product();
    List<Product> expectedProductsBeforeUpdate = Arrays.asList(product1);
    List<Product> expectedProductsAfterUpdate = Arrays.asList(product1, product2);
    when(productRepository.findAll()).thenReturn(expectedProductsBeforeUpdate, expectedProductsAfterUpdate);
    List<Product> actualProductsBeforeUpdate = productRepository.findAll();
    List<Product> actualProductsAfterUpdate = productRepository.findAll();
    assertEquals(expectedProductsBeforeUpdate, actualProductsBeforeUpdate, "Returned list of products should match the expected list of products before repository update");
    assertEquals(expectedProductsAfterUpdate, actualProductsAfterUpdate, "Returned list of products should match the expected list of products after repository update");
