Scenario 1: Test Creating a Valid Product

Details:
  TestName: testCreateValidProduct
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can successfully create a product when provided with a valid product object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Product object with all required fields filled in.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the created Product object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned Product object is the same as the one that was passed in.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the product created matches the product passed into the method. This is important to ensure the product is correctly saved in the repository.

Scenario 2: Test Creating a Product with Missing Fields

Details:
  TestName: testCreateProductWithMissingFields
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a Product object with missing fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with some required fields missing.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the incomplete Product object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if an exception is thrown when creating a product with missing fields. This is important to ensure the validity of the product data.

Scenario 3: Test Creating a Duplicate Product

Details:
  TestName: testCreateDuplicateProduct
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a Product object that is a duplicate of an existing product in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object that is identical to a product already in the repository.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the duplicate Product object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if an exception is thrown when creating a product that is a duplicate of an existing product. This is important to ensure the uniqueness of each product in the repository.

Scenario 4: Test Creating a Product with Invalid Field Values

Details:
  TestName: testCreateProductWithInvalidFieldValues
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a Product object with invalid field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with invalid field values.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the invalid Product object as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if an exception is thrown when creating a product with invalid field values. This is important to ensure the integrity of the product data.

/*
The test failure seems to be due to an issue with the Spring Boot test context setup, and it's not directly related to the business logic or the test case itself. The error states that a NoSuchMethodError was thrown when trying to create a new ServletContextApplicationContextInitializer. This kind of error typically occurs when there is a mismatch between the versions of dependencies in the project.

The specific method that can't be found is a constructor for ServletContextApplicationContextInitializer, which takes a ServletContext and a boolean as parameters. This could be because the version of Spring Boot used in the project doesn't match the version that the test context expects. 

To resolve this issue, you should check the versions of Spring Boot and any related dependencies in your project. Make sure they are compatible with each other and with the version of Spring Boot Test used in the test context. 

Remember, this is not an issue with the business logic or the test case itself, but rather with the configuration of the test environment. This issue needs to be resolved before the actual unit test can be run and validated.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testCreateValidProduct() {
    Product product = new Product();
    product.setName("Test Product");
    product.setDescription("Test Description");
    product.setPrice(100.0);
    Mockito.when(productRepository.save(product)).thenReturn(product);
    Product createdProduct = productController.createProduct(product);
    assertEquals(product, createdProduct);
}

/*
The test failure is due to a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` for the method `ServletContextApplicationContextInitializer.<init>(javax.servlet.ServletContext, boolean)`. This error typically occurs when there is a mismatch between the version of Spring Boot used at compile time and runtime, or between different Spring libraries.

In this case, the application might be using an outdated or incompatible version of Spring Boot or related Spring libraries than the one expected by the test context. The test context is trying to call a method that doesn't exist in the version of the library that's available in the classpath.

To fix this issue, ensure that all Spring libraries being used are compatible with each other. This typically means they should be from the same release train. If you're using a dependency management tool like Maven or Gradle, it can help manage compatible versions for you. 

You can also check if there are multiple versions of the same Spring library in the classpath. This can happen if the library is included both as a direct dependency and as a transitive dependency of another library. If this is the case, you might need to exclude one of them to avoid conflicts.

In summary, the test failure is not due to a problem in the test itself or the business logic it's testing, but due to a configuration issue in the project's dependencies.

@Tag("invalid")
public void testCreateProductWithMissingFields() {

The error logs suggest that the test case execution failed due to an issue with the Spring Boot test context setup, specifically related to the ServletContextApplicationContextInitializer. The error message is "java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'void org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.ServletContextApplicationContextInitializer.<init>(javax.servlet.ServletContext, boolean)'". 

This error is not related to the business logic of the test case or the method under test. It is an environmental issue, specifically a compatibility problem between different versions of Spring Boot and Spring Test frameworks. 

NoSuchMethodError is thrown if an application tries to call a specified method of a class (either static or instance), and that class no longer has a definition of that method. In this case, it appears there's a mismatch between the version of Spring Boot and Spring Test in the classpath. 

This might be caused by a version mismatch between the Spring Boot version that the test framework is expecting and the one that is actually in the classpath. The error indicates that the test framework is trying to call a constructor of ServletContextApplicationContextInitializer that doesn't exist in the current version of Spring Boot in the classpath.

The solution would be to ensure that the versions of Spring Boot and Spring Test being used are compatible with each other. This might involve updating the versions in the project's pom.xml file or ensuring that the correct versions are being used in the classpath.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testCreateDuplicateProduct() {
    Product product = new Product();
    product.setName("Test Product");
    product.setDescription("Test Description");
    product.setPrice(100.0);
    Mockito.when(productRepository.save(product)).thenReturn(product);
    assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> productController.createProduct(product));
}

/*
The test failure appears to be caused by a Spring Boot compatibility issue rather than an issue with the test case or the business logic. The error stack trace shows a `NoSuchMethodError`, which usually indicates that the application is using a version of a library that does not contain a method it expects to be present. In this case, the missing method is `'void org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.ServletContextApplicationContextInitializer.<init>(javax.servlet.ServletContext, boolean)'`.

This suggests that the version of Spring Boot used in the test environment is not compatible with the version expected by the test or some other part of the application. This could be due to a Spring Boot version mismatch between the application and test environment or an incorrect Spring Boot version specified in the project's pom.xml file.

Please ensure that the Spring Boot version used in the test environment matches the one required by the application. If the versions are correct and the issue persists, it may be necessary to check for conflicts with other libraries or dependencies in the project.
