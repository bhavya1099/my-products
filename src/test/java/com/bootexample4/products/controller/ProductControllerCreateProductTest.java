/*
The test failure is not due to any issues in the test function or the business logic. The error logs indicate that there is a NoSuchMethodError, which is a sign of incompatible versions of dependencies in your classpath.

The specific error message is: 'void org.springframework.web.context.ConfigurableWebApplicationContext.setServletContext(jakarta.servlet.ServletContext)'. This means that the method setServletContext of the class ConfigurableWebApplicationContext is not found. 

This issue might be due to the usage of incompatible versions of Spring Boot and Spring Web. The error logs suggest that the application is using Spring Boot version 3.0.5 and Spring Web version 5.3.10. 

The solution would be to ensure that all Spring dependencies are compatible with each other. You could achieve this by managing the versions through a BOM (Bill of Materials) or by using the Spring Boot Starter parent, which manages the versions for you. Also, make sure that there are no other versions of Spring or servlet API libraries in the classpath that could be causing conflicts. 

In conclusion, the test failure is due to a classpath issue and not due to the test function or the business logic.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testCreateProductWithValidInput() {
    Product product = new Product();
    product.setName("Test Product");
    product.setDescription("Test Description");
    product.setPrice(100.0);
    when(productRepository.save(product)).thenReturn(product);
    Product savedProduct = productController.createProduct(product);
    assertNotNull(savedProduct);
    verify(productRepository, times(1)).save(product);

The error logs indicate that the test case failed to execute due to a missing method exception. The specific error is `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'void org.springframework.web.context.ConfigurableWebApplicationContext.setServletContext(jakarta.servlet.ServletContext)'`. This error arises when a method is invoked at runtime, but the definition of the method can't be found.

This issue is not related to the business logic of the application or the unit test method. Instead, it's a problem with the Spring Boot version compatibility. 

The error message also provides a hint for the solution: "Correct the classpath of your application so that it contains compatible versions of the classes org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.ServletContextApplicationContextInitializer and org.springframework.web.context.ConfigurableWebApplicationContext". 

It appears that the application uses Spring Boot 3.0.5, but there might be a mismatch in the versions of other Spring or Jakarta libraries that are not compatible with this Spring Boot version. The method `setServletContext(jakarta.servlet.ServletContext)` might be present in a different version of the library, but not in the one currently in use.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that all the Spring and Jakarta libraries used in the application are compatible with each other and with the Spring Boot version. You might need to upgrade or downgrade some libraries to achieve this compatibility. 

It might be helpful to check the Spring Boot documentation or the Spring Initializr website to determine which versions of Spring libraries are recommended for use with the specific Spring Boot version.

@Tag("invalid")
public void testCreateProductWithNullInput() {
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> productController.createProduct(null));

/*
The test case is failing due to a version mismatch between Spring Boot and the Servlet API. The error log shows a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` for the method `setServletContext` in the class `org.springframework.web.context.ConfigurableWebApplicationContext`. This suggests that the version of the Servlet API being used in the application is not compatible with the current version of Spring Boot. 

The error message states: "The following method did not exist: 'void org.springframework.web.context.ConfigurableWebApplicationContext.setServletContext(jakarta.servlet.ServletContext)'". This indicates that the `setServletContext` method is not found in the `ConfigurableWebApplicationContext` class. 

There is a possibility that the application might be using the `jakarta.servlet.ServletContext` where Spring Boot is expecting the `javax.servlet.ServletContext`. 

This is a common issue when migrating from older versions of Spring Boot or the Servlet API, as the package name for the Servlet API has been changed from `javax.servlet` to `jakarta.servlet` in more recent versions. 

In conclusion, the test failure is not due to the test case logic itself, but rather due to a configuration issue in the application's dependencies. The application's classpath needs to be corrected so that it contains compatible versions of Spring Boot and the Servlet API.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testCreateProductWithIncompleteInput() {
    Product product = new Product();
    product.setName("Test Product");
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> productController.createProduct(product));
}

/*
The test is failing due to a compatibility issue between different versions of Spring and Jakarta Servlet. The error message indicates that there was an attempt to call the method 'setServletContext' in 'org.springframework.web.context.ConfigurableWebApplicationContext' from 'org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.ServletContextApplicationContextInitializer'. However, this method does not exist in the version of 'ConfigurableWebApplicationContext' that is being used. 

This issue is likely due to the fact that Spring 5 uses the 'javax.servlet' package while Spring 6 has moved to the 'jakarta.servlet' package. The error message suggests that the test is running with a mix of both versions, which is causing the NoSuchMethodError.

To resolve this issue, make sure that all dependencies in the project are compatible. If the project is using Spring 5, make sure all dependencies are aligned with this version. If the project is using Spring 6, make sure all dependencies are compatible with this version. You might need to exclude certain transitive dependencies or override them to ensure compatibility. 

Please note that the issue is not with the test case logic itself, but with the environment in which the test is being run.
