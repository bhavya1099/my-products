ROOST_METHOD_HASH=deleteProduct_032472106e
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Test to delete a product that exists in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test is to check if a product that exists in the repository can be deleted successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an existing product when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the existing product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is OK.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product was successfully deleted from the repository. If the product was deleted successfully, the method should return a response with an OK status.

Scenario 2: Test to delete a product that does not exist in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test is to check the behavior of the deleteProduct method when trying to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with an id that does not exist in the repository.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method returns a NOT_FOUND status when trying to delete a product that does not exist in the repository. This is the expected behavior as per the method implementation.

Scenario 3: Test to delete a product with null id

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test is to check the behavior of the deleteProduct method when called with a null id.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the id is null.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null id.
  Assert: Assert that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an IllegalArgumentException when called with a null id. This is the expected behavior as per the method implementation, as the id cannot be null.
