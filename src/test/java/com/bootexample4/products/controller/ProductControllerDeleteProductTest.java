Scenario 1: Successful product deletion

  Details:
    TestName: deleteProductByIdTest
    Description: This test scenario aims to validate the successful deletion of a product record when a valid product ID is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create some product records using productRepository's save method. Pick one specific product and get its ID.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the ID of the desired product to be deleted.
    Assert: Assert if the return status of the called method is 200 meaning that the deletion was successful.
  Validation:
    The assertion is meant to verify if a product record can be successfully deleted when provided with a valid id. If it is indeed possible, it would mean that the deleteProduct method in the class ProductController is working as expected in this scenario.

Scenario 2: Deleting non-existent product

  Details:
    TestName: deleteNonExistentProductTest
    Description: This test scenario is meant to verify how the deleteProduct method handles requests to delete a product that does not exist in the database.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Confirm that there are no product records in the database initially or create some product records, making sure to use product IDs that are clearly different from the test ID.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an ID for a product that does not exist in the database.
    Assert: Assert that the status returned from the method is 404, indicating that the sought product was not found in the database.
  Validation:
    This test is designed to make sure that the deleteProduct method can gracefully handle attempts to delete non-existing products. It is an important test as it checks the robustness of the method against invalid input; it shouldn't crash or behave unexpectedly when provided with an invalid product ID.

Scenario 3: Deleting product with null id

  Details:
    TestName: deleteProductWithNullIdTest
    Description: This scenario checks how the method deleteProduct handles requests to delete a product with a null ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange any data as weâ€™re testing the deletion with null.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with null as the ID.
    Assert: As per the method, it should throw an exception prior to the null check. Confirm if the exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the method throws the appropriate exception when a null id parameter is provided. This is crucial to validate the robustness of the method when handling invalid input. The deleteProduct method is not supposed to accept null as an id parameter.
