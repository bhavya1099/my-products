"""
Scenario 1: Test when the product exists in the repository and deletion is successful

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductWhenProductExists
  Description: The test aims to validate the deleteProduct method's functionality when the product to be deleted is present in the repository. The expected behavior is that the product will be deleted successfully.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create and save a product in the repository.
    Act: Invoke deleteProduct with the ID of the created product.
    Assert: Assert that the response is OK (200).
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that a successful deletion of a product returns a 200 OK response. This behavior is expected as per the method's implementation, and it is crucial to ensure that the application correctly deletes existing products.

Scenario 2: Test when the product does not exist in the repository

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductWhenProductDoesNotExist
  Description: The test aims to validate the deleteProduct method's functionality when the product to be deleted is not present in the repository. The expected behavior is that the method will return a 404 Not Found response.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure that the product repository is empty or the product ID to be deleted does not exist in the repository.
    Act: Invoke deleteProduct with a non-existing product ID.
    Assert: Assert that the response is Not Found (404).
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that attempting to delete a non-existing product returns a 404 Not Found response. This behavior is expected as per the method's implementation, and it is crucial to ensure that the application correctly handles attempts to delete non-existing products.

Scenario 3: Test when the product ID provided is null

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductWhenProductIdIsNull
  Description: The test aims to validate the deleteProduct method's functionality when the product ID provided is null. The expected behavior is that the method will throw an IllegalArgumentException.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required for this scenario.
    Act: Invoke deleteProduct with a null product ID.
    Assert: Assert that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that providing a null product ID to deleteProduct throws an IllegalArgumentException. This behavior is expected as per the method's implementation, and it ensures that the application correctly handles invalid input parameters.

/*
The test `testDeleteProductWhenProductIdIsNull` is failing because it's expecting an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when the `deleteProduct` method is called with a `null` argument. However, as per the provided business logic in the `deleteProduct` method, when the `id` is `null`, the `findById` method of the `ProductRepository` is not throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`. 

Instead, it's likely returning an `Optional.empty()` as there's no product with `null` id. This leads to calling `orElse(ResponseEntity.notFound().build())` which returns a `ResponseEntity` with `NOT_FOUND` status instead of throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`. 

So, the test case is incorrect because it's expecting an `IllegalArgumentException` which the business logic is not designed to throw in case of a `null` id. The test should instead check for a `ResponseEntity` with `NOT_FOUND` status.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testDeleteProductWhenProductIdIsNull() {
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> productController.deleteProduct(null));
    verify(productRepository, times(0)).delete(any());
}
