"""
Scenario 1: Product Found and Deleted Successfully
Details:
  TestName: testProductDeletionSuccess
  Description: This test is meant to check if the product is found and successfully deleted when a valid product id is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a product when findById is called with the valid product id.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the valid product id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned ResponseEntity's status is 200 OK.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the product was found and deleted successfully. The expected result is a 200 OK status, which indicates that the operation was successful. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the deleteProduct method.
Scenario 2: Product Not Found
Details:
  TestName: testProductNotFound
  Description: This test is meant to check the response when an invalid product id is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty result when findById is called with the invalid product id.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the invalid product id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned ResponseEntity's status is 404 Not Found.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the appropriate response is returned when a product is not found. The expected result is a 404 Not Found status, indicating that the requested product does not exist. This test is important as it verifies the error handling capability of the deleteProduct method.
Scenario 3: Product id is null
Details:
  TestName: testProductIdIsNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the response when the product id provided is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data needs to be set up for this test.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null product id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that an exception is thrown when the product id is null. This is expected as the product id is required to find and delete a product. This test is important as it verifies the method's handling of null inputs.
