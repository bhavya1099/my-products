**Scenario 1: Product Found and Successfully Deleted**

Details:
TestName: deleteExistingProduct
Description: This test checks if the deleteProduct method successfully deletes a product when the specified ID corresponds to an existing product in the database.

Execution:
Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an optional of a product when findById is called with a specific ID, and also to confirm deletion behavior.
Act: Call deleteProduct method with the ID.
Assert: Verify that the response entity status is OK and that delete method on the repository is called once.

Validation:
The assertion verifies that the response is HttpStatus.OK, confirming that the delete operation was successful. It is important because it ensures that the application can handle typical delete operations, maintaining data integrity and usability within the application.

**Scenario 2: Product Not Found**

Details:
TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
Description: This test is designed to verify the response when attempting to delete a product with an ID that does not exist in the product repository.

Execution:
Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with an invalid or non-existent ID.
Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the non-existent ID.
Assert: Ensure that the ResponseEntity returns a NotFound status code.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the ResponseEntity returned is with status NotFound. This is crucial for confirming that the method correctly handles the absence of a product ID, which could represent a common user error or irregular situation and informs the user accordingly through API responses.

**Scenario 3: Repository Throws Exception on Delete**

Details:
TestName: deleteProductRepositoryException
Description: Test to check behavior of the deleteProduct method if the productRepository.delete() method throws an exception.

Execution:
Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid product on findById and then to throw a RuntimeException when delete is called.
Act: Attempt to delete this valid product by invoking the deleteProduct method.
Assert: Capture and assert the exception thrown by the controller to ensure it handles the scenario robustly.

Validation:
This scenario's assertion aims to test the method's robustness in the face of database connectivity issues or any other problems that might cause an exception during the deletion process. It ensures that the system can gracefully handle exceptions without crashing, preferably providing useful information back to a client or logging systems.

---

**Scenario 4: Product ID Null**

Details:
TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
Description: Checks the response when deleteProduct is called with a null ID to verify that method arguments are properly validated.

Execution:
Arrange: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null value for the ID.
Act: Observe and handle any exception or response handling behavior.
Assert: Verify if the proper exception is thrown or if the correct response is returned for bad input handling.

Validation:
The assertion confirms that proper input validation is in place, which is critical for preventing errors further down the line in the database operations. This also avoids unnecessary database calls and provides immediate feedback regarding incorrect API usage.
