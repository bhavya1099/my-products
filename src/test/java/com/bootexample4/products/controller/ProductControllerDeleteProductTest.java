ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteProduct_65c62d8b91

Scenario 1: Test to delete a product that exists in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: The test is designed to check if a product that exists in the repository can be deleted successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an existing product when findById is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the id of the existing product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has an OK status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product is deleted successfully. The expected result is based on the assumption that if a product exists in the repository, it should be deleted successfully.

Scenario 2: Test to delete a product that does not exist in the repository

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: The test is designed to check how the method behaves when a product that does not exist in the repository is to be deleted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with an id that does not exist in the repository.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has a NOT_FOUND status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case where a product to be deleted does not exist in the repository. The expected result is based on the assumption that if a product does not exist in the repository, the method should return a NOT_FOUND status.

Scenario 3: Test to delete a product when the repository is empty

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductFromEmptyRepository
  Description: The test is designed to check how the method behaves when the repository is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called.
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with any id.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has a NOT_FOUND status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case where the repository is empty. The expected result is based on the assumption that if the repository is empty, the method should return a NOT_FOUND status.
