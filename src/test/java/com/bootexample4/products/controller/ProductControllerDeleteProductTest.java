"""
  Scenario 1: Product exists and is successfully deleted
  Details:
    TestName: testProductDeletionSuccess
    Description: This test is meant to check if the product is successfully deleted when a valid product id is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById() is called.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the mocked Product.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned ResponseEntity's status is OK (200).
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the product was found and deleted successfully. The expected result is a status of 200, indicating that the deletion was successful. This test is significant as it confirms the application's ability to delete products correctly when provided with a valid id.
  Scenario 2: Product does not exist
  Details:
    TestName: testProductDeletionFailure
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when an invalid product id is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return empty when findById() is called.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with an invalid product id.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND (404).
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario where the product id provided does not correspond to an existing product. The expected result is a status of 404, indicating that the product was not found. This test is significant as it validates the application's error handling capabilities when attempting to delete a non-existent product.
  Scenario 3: Exception during product deletion
  Details:
    TestName: testProductDeletionException
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when an exception occurs during the deletion process.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById() is called and throw an exception when delete() is called.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the mocked Product.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles exceptions during the deletion process. This test is significant as it ensures that the application behaves correctly in the face of unexpected errors during product deletion.
