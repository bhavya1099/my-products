``` 
Scenario 1: Testing successful deletion of a product by valid id

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulProductDeletionByValidId
  Description: Verify that a product is successfully deleted when a valid id is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a valid product id that exists in the database.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid id.
    Assert: Check that the response is ResponseEntity with status code OK.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the product is deleted as expected, maintaining data consistency in the system.

Scenario 2: Testing deletion of a non-existing product

Details:  
  TestName: testProductDeletionByNonExistingId
  Description: Ensure that the method handles the case where the provided id does not correspond to any existing product.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a product id that does not exist in the database.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the non-existing id.
    Assert: Verify that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT FOUND.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the method gracefully handles the scenario where the product to be deleted is not found.

Scenario 3: Testing deletion with null id

Details:  
  TestName: testProductDeletionByNullId
  Description: Check the behavior of the method when a null id is passed for deletion.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the id parameter as null.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with a null id.
    Assert: Ensure that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT FOUND.
  Validation: 
    This test validates the method's ability to handle null input gracefully and respond with the correct status.

Scenario 4: Testing deletion with negative id

Details:  
  TestName: testProductDeletionByNegativeId
  Description: Verify the method's response when a negative id is provided for deletion.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a negative value as the product id.
    Act: Execute the deleteProduct method with the negative id.
    Assert: Confirm that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT FOUND.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the method correctly handles invalid input such as negative ids.

Scenario 5: Testing deletion with a very large id

Details:  
  TestName: testProductDeletionByLargeId
  Description: Check the method's behavior when an excessively large id is used for deletion.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an extremely large value as the product id.
    Act: Trigger the deleteProduct method with the large id.
    Assert: Validate that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT FOUND.
  Validation: 
    This scenario tests the method's robustness against potential issues related to large input values.

Scenario 6: Testing deletion with empty id

Details:  
  TestName: testProductDeletionByEmptyId
  Description: Validate how the method handles an empty id parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an empty id value.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the empty id.
    Assert: Ensure that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT FOUND.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the method correctly handles cases where the id parameter is empty.
