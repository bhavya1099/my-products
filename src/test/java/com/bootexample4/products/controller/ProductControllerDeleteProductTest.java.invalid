``` 
Scenario 1: Testing successful deletion of a product by valid id

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulProductDeletionByValidId
  Description: Verify that a product is successfully deleted when a valid id is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a valid product id that exists in the database.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the valid id.
    Assert: Check that the response is ResponseEntity with status code OK.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the product is deleted as expected based on the provided id.
    This test is crucial to confirm the correct functionality of deleting existing products.

Scenario 2: Testing deletion of a non-existing product

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: Ensure that attempting to delete a non-existing product returns a not found response.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an id that does not correspond to any existing product.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the non-existing id.
    Assert: Verify that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT_FOUND.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks the behavior of the method when trying to delete a product that does not exist.
    This test is important to validate the handling of non-existent product deletion.

Scenario 3: Testing deletion with a null id

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithNullId
  Description: Validate the behavior when deleting a product with a null id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the id parameter to null.
    Act: Execute the deleteProduct method with the null id.
    Assert: Ensure that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT_FOUND.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms the expected outcome when attempting to delete a product with a null id.
    Verifying the behavior for null id scenarios enhances the robustness of the method.

Scenario 4: Testing deletion with a negative id

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithNegativeId
  Description: Check the response when trying to delete a product with a negative id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a negative id value.
    Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the negative id.
    Assert: Validate that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT_FOUND.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures proper handling of negative id inputs for product deletion.
    Testing with negative id helps in identifying potential issues related to input validation.

Scenario 5: Testing deletion with a very large id

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithLargeId
  Description: Verify the behavior when attempting to delete a product with a very large id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use a large id value that exceeds the normal range of product ids.
    Act: Trigger the deleteProduct method with the large id.
    Assert: Confirm that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT_FOUND.
  Validation: 
    This test assesses the method's response to large id values that may be beyond the expected range.
    Testing with large id inputs helps in ensuring proper handling of extreme cases.

Scenario 6: Testing deletion with an empty database

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteProductFromEmptyDatabase
  Description: Test the deletion operation when the database is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure that the database is empty.
    Act: Attempt to delete a product using any id.
    Assert: Validate that the response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT_FOUND.
  Validation: 
    This test evaluates the behavior of the deleteProduct method in the absence of any products in the database.
    Handling deletion from an empty database is an important aspect of the method's functionality.
