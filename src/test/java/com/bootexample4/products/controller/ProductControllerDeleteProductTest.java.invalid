``` 
Scenario 1: Testing successful deletion of an existing product

Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulDeleteProduct
  Description: Verify that the deleteProduct method successfully deletes an existing product when a valid product ID is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a product for the given ID.
    Act: Call deleteProduct method with a valid product ID.
    Assert: Check that the method returns ResponseEntity with status code OK.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the delete operation works correctly and removes the specified product from the repository.

Scenario 2: Testing deletion of a non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: Ensure that the deleteProduct method returns a not found response when attempting to delete a product that does not exist.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to not find any product for the given ID.
    Act: Call deleteProduct method with a non-existing product ID.
    Assert: Verify that the method returns ResponseEntity with status code NOT FOUND.
  Validation:
    This test confirms that the method handles the scenario where the product to be deleted does not exist.

Scenario 3: Testing deletion with null product ID

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithNullId
  Description: Validate that the deleteProduct method returns a not found response when a null product ID is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the test with a null product ID.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null product ID.
    Assert: Ensure that the method returns ResponseEntity with status code NOT FOUND.
  Validation:
    This test guarantees that the method correctly handles the case when an invalid (null) product ID is passed for deletion.

Scenario 4: Testing deletion with negative product ID

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithNegativeId
  Description: Check that the deleteProduct method handles a negative product ID by returning a not found response.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the test with a negative product ID.
    Act: Call deleteProduct method with a negative product ID.
    Assert: Validate that the method response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT FOUND.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the method gracefully handles the situation where a negative product ID is provided for deletion.

Scenario 5: Testing deletion with a valid but non-existent product ID

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: Verify that the deleteProduct method returns a not found response when attempting to delete a valid but non-existent product.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the productRepository to not find any product for the given valid ID.
    Act: Invoke deleteProduct method with a valid but non-existent product ID.
    Assert: Confirm that the method response is ResponseEntity with status code NOT FOUND.
  Validation:
    This test confirms the correct behavior of the method when a valid but non-existent product ID is used for deletion.
