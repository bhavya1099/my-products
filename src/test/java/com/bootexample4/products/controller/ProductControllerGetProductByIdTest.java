"""
Scenario 1: Test getProductById with valid id
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductByIdWithValidId
  Description: This test checks the getProductById method when a valid product id is provided. The expected behavior is that the method returns the correct product details.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a predefined Product when findById is called with a valid id.
  Act: Call getProductById with the valid id.
  Assert: The returned ResponseEntity should contain the expected product and have a status of 200 OK.
Validation:
  This test validates that the getProductById method correctly fetches a product by its id. It ensures that the application can retrieve individual products from the database.

Scenario 2: Test getProductById with non-existing id
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductByIdWithNonExistingId
  Description: This test checks the getProductById method when a non-existing product id is provided. The expected behavior is that the method returns a 404 Not Found status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existing id.
  Act: Call getProductById with the non-existing id.
  Assert: The returned ResponseEntity should not contain a product and have a status of 404 Not Found.
Validation:
  This test validates that the getProductById method correctly handles cases where the requested product does not exist. It ensures that the application appropriately handles requests for non-existent resources.

Scenario 3: Test getProductById with null id
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductByIdWithNullId
  Description: This test checks the getProductById method when a null id is provided. The expected behavior is that the method throws an IllegalArgumentException.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to mock anything for this test.
  Act: Call getProductById with a null id.
  Assert: An IllegalArgumentException should be thrown.
Validation:
  This test validates that the getProductById method correctly handles cases where the provided id is null. It ensures that the application appropriately validates input parameters.

/*
The unit test is failing due to a NullPointerException on the invocation of "productRepository.findById(Object)" method. The error message indicates that "this.productRepository" is null. 

This means that the ProductRepository instance, which the test is trying to use, is not initialized. In the context of a unit test, this is typically because the object hasn't been mocked or injected correctly. 

In order to fix this issue, you need to ensure that the ProductRepository instance is properly initialized before the test runs. This is usually done in a setup method annotated with @Before (JUnit 4) or @BeforeEach (JUnit 5) which runs before each test, or by using a mocking framework such as Mockito to create a mock instance of the repository.

Please ensure that the ProductRepository is not null before running the test. You can do this by initializing it manually or by using a mock framework to create a mock instance of the ProductRepository.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testGetProductByIdWithValidId() {
    Long id = 1L;
    Product product = new Product();
    product.setId(id);
    when(productRepository.findById(id)).thenReturn(Optional.of(product));
    ResponseEntity<Product> response = productController.getProductById(id);
    assertEquals(200, response.getStatusCodeValue());
    assertEquals(product, response.getBody());
}

/*
The error log indicates that a NullPointerException was thrown because `this.productRepository` is null. This means that the instance of `ProductRepository` that's being used in the test method `testGetProductByIdWithNonExistingId()` is not initialized. 

In the context of the test, `productRepository` is a mock object and it should be initialized before the test runs. This could be done in a setup method annotated with `@BeforeEach` or directly in the test method. 

The failure is not due to the business logic as the method `getProductById` is handling the case when the product is not found by returning a `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()`, which corresponds to a 404 status. 

So, the test is failing because of a missing initialization of the `ProductRepository` mock in the test setup. It's not an issue with the business logic or the test case itself. The external dependency `ProductRepository` needs to be correctly initialized for this test to run successfully.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testGetProductByIdWithNonExistingId() {
    Long id = 1L;
    when(productRepository.findById(id)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
    ResponseEntity<Product> response = productController.getProductById(id);
    assertEquals(404, response.getStatusCodeValue());
}

/*
The test `testGetProductByIdWithNullId` is expected to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when a null value is provided as the input. However, the error log indicates that a `NullPointerException` is actually being thrown instead.

This discrepancy is likely due to how the `getProductById` method is implemented. The method seems to be using the input parameter `id` directly without checking if it is null or not. When `id` is null, the `findById(id)` method call on `productRepository` is likely to throw a `NullPointerException`.

To fix the issue, the `getProductById` method should include a null check for the `id` parameter and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is null. This change will make the method behave as expected according to the test `testGetProductByIdWithNullId`. 

Alternatively, if the business logic is such that `getProductById` should indeed throw a `NullPointerException` when the `id` is null, then the test should be updated to expect a `NullPointerException` instead of an `IllegalArgumentException`.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testGetProductByIdWithNullId() {
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> productController.getProductById(null));
}
