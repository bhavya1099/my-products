Scenario 1: Valid Product Name Retrieval

Details:
  TestName: getNameFromProductWithValidName
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the getName() method to ensure it returns the correct product name. The test is essential for validating data consistency and correct data retrieval from Product objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its name to a known non-null, non-empty string ("Product A").
  Act: Call the getName() method on the created Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned name matches the expected name ("Product A").
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getName() method properly retrieves the name that was set for the product. It's crucial for displaying the correct product names in user interfaces or processing them in business logic.

Scenario 2: Product Name Retrieval When Name Is Null

Details:
  TestName: getNameFromProductWithNullName
  Description: This test examines how the getName() method handles a Product instance where the name is set to null. Handling null values gracefully is essential to avoid NullPointerExceptions during runtime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance without setting a name, implicitly keeping it null.
  Act: Call the getName() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned name is null.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getName() method returns null when the Productâ€™s name has not been initialized. Validating this behavior is fundamental for operations where name fields might not be mandatory, and the system should not crash when encountering such situations.

Scenario 3: Product Name is An Empty String

Details:
  TestName: getNameFromProductWithEmptyName
  Description: This test verifies the outcome of getName() when the Product's name is an empty string. It's crucial to ensure that the method can handle empty values correctly, which can often occur in data entry or processing errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its name to an empty string ("").
  Act: Call the getName() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned name is the empty string ("").
Validation:
  Testing with an empty string verifies that the getName() method does not modify such inputs and can handle them appropriately. This is important for consistency across different data management operations where empty strings might be a valid scenario.

Scenario 4: Product Initialization Without Setting Name

Details:
  TestName: getNameFromUninitializedProductName
  Description: This scenario tests the default behavior of the getName() method when a Product instance is created but the name is not explicitly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance without setting the name.
  Act: Call the getName() method on this new Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned name is null.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the default state for a Product's name attribute is null if not set otherwise. This understanding is crucial for functions that may rely on the presence or absence of a name value and prevents assumptions that could lead to errors in application logic or data handling.
