"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct price is returned
Details:
  TestName: testCorrectPriceReturned.
  Description: This test is to validate if the getPrice method is returning the correct price that has been set for the product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price of the product to any particular value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is the same as the one that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is working as expected and returning the correct price. The significance of this test lies in ensuring that the correct price is displayed to the user when this method is invoked.
Scenario 2: Test to verify default price is returned when no price is set
Details:
  TestName: testDefaultPriceReturnedWhenNoPriceSet.
  Description: This test is to validate if the getPrice method returns the default price when no price has been set for the product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set a price for the product.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is the default price (0.0).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is working as expected and returning the default price when no price has been set. This test is significant in ensuring that a default price is displayed to the user when the price has not been set.
Scenario 3: Test to verify that negative price is not returned
Details:
  TestName: testNegativePriceNotReturned.
  Description: This test is to validate if the getPrice method does not return a negative price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price of the product to a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is not negative.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is not returning a negative price. The significance of this test lies in ensuring that a negative price is not displayed to the user, as this would be incorrect.
Scenario 4: Test to verify that price is not null
Details:
  TestName: testPriceNotNull.
  Description: This test is to validate if the getPrice method does not return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price of the product.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getPrice method is not returning null. The significance of this test lies in ensuring that a null price is not displayed to the user, as this would cause errors in further calculations or operations involving the price.
