"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct price is returned
Details:
  TestName: testCorrectPriceReturned.
  Description: This test is to validate if the getPrice method is returning the correct price that has been set for the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class and set a specific price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the price that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPrice method is functioning correctly and returning the correct price. This is significant as the price is a crucial attribute of the object and must be accurately maintained and retrieved.
Scenario 2: Test to verify default price when no price is set
Details:
  TestName: testDefaultPriceReturned.
  Description: This test is to validate if the getPrice method is returning the default price when no price has been set for the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class without setting a price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the default price (i.e., 0.0 as the initial value is null).
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPrice method is functioning correctly and returning the default price when no price is set. This is significant as it ensures that the object's price attribute is correctly initialized and handled.
Scenario 3: Test to verify the price after changing it
Details:
  TestName: testPriceAfterChanging.
  Description: This test is to validate if the getPrice method is returning the updated price after it has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class and set a specific price. Then, change the price to a new value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the new price that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPrice method is functioning correctly and returning the updated price after it has been changed. This is significant as it ensures that the price attribute can be accurately updated and retrieved.
Scenario 4: Test to verify the price with maximum double value
Details:
  TestName: testPriceWithMaxDouble.
  Description: This test is to validate if the getPrice method is correctly handling and returning the price when it is set to the maximum double value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class and set the price to the maximum double value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned price is equal to the maximum double value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPrice method is correctly handling and returning the price even when it is set to extreme values. This is significant as it tests the robustness of the getPrice method and the system's ability to handle edge cases.
