Scenario 1: Verify getId returns null for a new Product instance

Details:
  TestName: verifyGetIdReturnsNullForNewProduct
  Description: This test ensures that the getId method returns null when called on a newly created Product instance which has not been initialized with an ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product.
  Act: Call the getId method on the new Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion verifies that the ID is null initially, reflecting an entity that has not yet been persisted or assigned an ID.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: This test verifies the default behavior of entities with regard to their identifier management before persistence operations have assigned identifiers.

Scenario 2: Test getId after manually setting an ID via reflection since direct setting is not available

Details:
  TestName: verifyGetIdAfterSettingIdWithReflection
  Description: This test checks if the getId method accurately retrieves the ID set through Java Reflection (used here to simulate the persistence layer setting an ID, as we assume no setter methods available directly).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product and use reflection to inject an ID into the private 'id' field.
  Act: Call the getId method on this Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is the same as the value set via reflection.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that getId correctly retrieves the value of the ID field after it has been set, mimicking the behavior post-persistence.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring that the 'getId' accurately reflects the assigned ID is crucial for entity tracking and database operations post-persistence.

Scenario 3: Ensure getId remains consistent across multiple calls

Details:
  TestName: verifyGetIdConsistencyAcrossCalls
  Description: This scenario tests that multiple calls to getId on the same Product instance return consistent results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product and set an ID using reflection.
  Act: Call getId multiple times on the same instance.
  Assert: Assert that all calls return the same value.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This test ensures that the 'getId' method returns a consistent ID value across multiple invocations, indicating the immutability of the ID in a given context.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Consistency in the returned ID across calls is important for ensuring reliable entity identification throughout the application's operations.
```

These scenarios collectively test the basic operation and expected behaviors surrounding the `getId` method of a presumed JPA entity class, ensuring that the method handles uninitialized states, manipulated states (simulating behavior post-persistence), and consistently behaves as expected across multiple invocations.
