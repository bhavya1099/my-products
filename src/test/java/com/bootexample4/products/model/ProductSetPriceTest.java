"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Positive Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithPositiveValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method successfully sets the price when a positive value is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a positive double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against the passed positive value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is set correctly when a positive value is passed. This is essential to ensure that the price of an entity can be updated correctly.
  Scenario 2: Test for Zero Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithZeroValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method successfully sets the price when zero is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with zero.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is set correctly when zero is passed. This is vital to ensure that the price of an entity can be set to zero if required.
  Scenario 3: Test for Negative Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithNegativeValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method successfully sets the price when a negative value is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a negative double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against the passed negative value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is set correctly when a negative value is passed. This is critical to ensure that the price of an entity can be updated correctly, even with negative values.
  Scenario 4: Test for Null Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithNullValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method throws a NullPointerException when null is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with null.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method throws a NullPointerException when null is passed. This is crucial to ensure that the method handles null values correctly.

	// Removed testSetPriceWithNullValue test because the setPrice method does not accept
	// null values.
	// The method signature is setPrice(double price) which means it only accepts double
	// values.
	// Null is not a valid argument for this method hence the test is invalid and not
	// needed.
